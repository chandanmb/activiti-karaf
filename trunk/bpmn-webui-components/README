This project (bpmn-webui-components) and its sub projects takes the source
code (At svn revision 68.) from signavio core components google code project
(see http://code.google.com/p/signavio-core-components/) and add maven project
modules to build the components using maven and refactor the code
to work in Apache Karaf OSGi Container as well as any web container

Components built with this maven project modules are used in the activiti-karaf
main project to build the web based activiti bpmn modeler in the activiti-karaf project.
